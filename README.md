# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. 

These are the game rules:
1) If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
2) Rock beats Scissors
3) Paper beats Rock
4) Scissors beats Paper

In this version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player)
